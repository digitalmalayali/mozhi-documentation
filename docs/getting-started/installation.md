# Installation

As mentioned earlier, Mozhi scheme is used by various input tools. You can use any of them, although we'd highly recommend Mozhi with Keyman software.

## Google Input Tools

You can use Google Input Tools as a browser extension or through an Android app called Indic Keyboard. Browser extension is available only for Chromium based browsers such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) etc.

### Extension

For installing the extension:
- visit [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab)
- and click on `Add to Chrome`.

A detailed documentation of the extension can be found [here](https://www.google.com/inputtools/).

### Android App

Indic Keyboard is an open source Android app that utilizes Mozhi scheme for Malayalam language. It can be installed from:
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic)
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.smc.inputmethod.indic/)
- [Direct Download](https://releases.smc.org.in/indic-keyboard/)

More details of the app can be found on their [website](https://indic.app/).

## Keyman

Keyman is a powerful keyboard engine and software that helps to type over 2000 languages. It supports multiple language keyboard layouts at a time. You could find that there are multiple layouts available for a single language.

You need to install the Keyman software first and then download and install [Mozhi keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/mozhi_malayalam). Keyman is available for [Windows](https://keyman.com/windows/), [Linux](https://keyman.com/linux/), [Mac](https://keyman.com/mac/), [iOS](https://keyman.com/iphone-and-ipad/), [Android](https://keyman.com/android/) and [web](https://keyman.com/keymanweb/). A detailed help guide can be found on their [website](https://help.keyman.com/).
